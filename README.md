# Play wordpress wright
An e2e testing tool with playwright within WordPress.

## Prerequisites:

Must have `WP CLI` [installed](https://wp-cli.org/).

## Installation process:

## ‚ö†Ô∏èÔ∏è Attention ‚ö†Ô∏è

Currently don't install, download this from [github](https://github.com/RatulHasan/play-wordpress-wright), then copy and paste the `swapEnvironment.js` and `swapBackEnvironment.js` in your plugin root directory. 

Then, Copy your `wp-config.php` file and place it in your plugin root directory like `akismet/` and rename it with `playwright-wp-config.php`.

Add these line in `playwright-wp-config.php`
```
define( 'SITE_URL', 'your_site_url' ); 
define( 'SITE_TITLE', 'Site_Name' );
define( 'ADMIN_USERNAME', 'UserName' ); // This is not database username. This is login user name.
define( 'ADMIN_PASSWORD', 'Password' ); // This is not database password. This is login password.
define( 'ADMIN_EMAIL', 'admin@email.com' );
```

Add these lines in `playwright.config.js` file within `config` section.
```
globalSetup: require.resolve( './swapEnvironment' ),
globalTeardown: require.resolve( './swapBackEnvironment' ),
```
This `swapEnvironment.js` file offers you some methods like-

- `dropDatabaseTables()` - This will reset your test database.
- `installWP()` - This will refresh your WordPress installation.
- `renameFile(src, dest)` - This will rename file.
- `readWpConfigFile()` - This will read wp-config file and gives you defined values.
